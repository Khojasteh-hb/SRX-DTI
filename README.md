## SRX-DTI

Predicting drug-target interactions based on fusing multiple features with data balancing and feature selection techniques

Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is an important research area in the field of drug discovery. It means identifying interactions between chemical compounds and the protein targets.  Wet lab experiments to explore these interactions are expensive as well as time-consuming. On the contrary, a dry lab environment focusing more on computational methods of interaction prediction can be helpful to limit the search space for these experiments and give clues before developing a new medicine. This paper proposes a novel drugâ€“target interaction prediction method called SRX-DTI. First, we extract various descriptors from the protein sequences; and the drug is encoded as an FP2 molecular fingerprint. For handling the class imbalance problem, we propose the One-SVM-US technique to deal with imbalanced data. We also develop the FFS-RF algorithm, a forward feature selection algorithm, and coupled it with the random forest (RF) classifier to maximize the predictive performance. The forward feature selection algorithm adds new features to a set of selected features as far as the predictive power is improved. This feature selection algorithm removes the irrelevant features to obtain the best optimal features. Finally, the balanced dataset with optimal features is given to the XGBoost classifier to identify DTIs. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach SRX-DTI achieves significantly higher performance than other existing methods in predicting DTIs.
